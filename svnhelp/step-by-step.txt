- go to the repository server folder

    cd <SVN-REPO-SOURCES>
    svnadmin create <new-project>

- then go to the source you want to import
  then must make 3 dirs: branches, tags, trunk
  and put all source files in trunk

    cd <origin-dir>
    mkdir trunk
    mv * trunk/
    mkdir branches
    mkdir tags

- import 

    svn import <origin-dir> file://<SVN-REPO-SOURCES>/<new-project> -m "initial import"

- now create a working directory, by checking out

    cd <the-parent-dir-where-you-want-to-modify-the-project>

    svn checkout file://<SVN-REPO-SOURCES>/<new-project> <new-project>

   svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
   (some options: file:// http:// https:// svn:// svn+ssh:// )

- now svn-working is your working directory, do all work there

- then just go inside your working directory, do whatever you want
  there, and you can do anything below in any directory in the project:

    % svn diff

    % svn commit

  (don't forget to set $SVN_EDITOR to emacs)

  (must do at the root to propagate everything)

    % svn update
    (not used if working alone)
