         consistency level refers to how many replicas are going to be
         in the cluster.
         Currently
            - 'all' - replica in each node of the cluster
            - 'quorum' - replica in majority(all_nodes / 2 + 1) of the cluster
            are accepted.

         selecting different filter values will run different experiments.
         List of implemented filters
         ReadRepair1 - runs read repair workload with first filter
             Node0 sends a read message
            -> node2's read digest message gets corrupted.
            -> node1's read data message gets corrupted.
            -> node3 crashes.

         ReadRepair2 - ... second filter
            Node0 sends a read message
            -> node1's read data message gets corrupted.
            -> node1 crashes.

         ReadRepair3 - ... third filter
            simulates a read repair mechanism by corrupting
            Node0 sends a read message
            -> node2's read digest message gets corrupted
            -> node2's read data message gets corrupted.
            -> node3 crashes.
            *refer to read repair section in Cassandra manual for the explanation of read repair mechanism.

         Insertion1 - runs insertion workload with first filter
            Crashes any nodes when it is sending out any message through
            DataOutputStream. In higher level picture, we fail any messages
            sent during the insert operation.

         Insertion2 - ... second filter
            Crashes node0 when it receives any callback messages. -->
