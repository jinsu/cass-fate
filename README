Cassandra Automated Fault Injection
snapshot of my research project.

prereq:
need ant installed

uses thrift

java-rtjar contains some jars needed for the project.
java-rtjar/sdk should contain either rt.jar(for linux) or __blank__(for mac).

cass-prj/trunk contains the modified code for cassandra and its workload driver.
see cass-prj/trunk/README for more details regarding the code.
